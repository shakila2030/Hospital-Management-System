# 🏥 Hospital Management System - Microservices Architecture

## 📜 Overview
Welcome to the **Hospital Management System** project! This application is built using **Spring Boot** and follows a **Microservices Architecture**. It is designed to manage the hospital's core services, such as:

- **Patient Registration** 🧑‍⚕️
- **Doctor Management** 👩‍⚕️
- **Appointment Scheduling** 📅

The system leverages **Eureka Server** for **service discovery**, ensuring that microservices can communicate with each other seamlessly. Each microservice operates independently, which makes it easy to scale and maintain.
